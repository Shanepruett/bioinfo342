I think I have the basic GeneBankSearch.java class written... I am sure I am missing stuff that 
we will come across later on in the project and I have not fully tested it, but I am starting to feel a sore throat
coming on so I want to get some sleep... I will test this tomorrow and see what needs to be changed or if I can think 
of anything to add.
